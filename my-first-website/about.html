            Hi! I'm Chelsea, and I am a UX/UI designer with a background in Outdoor Education and Adventure Tourism. Through my extensive experience working with participants of all ages in an Education-based environment, I am able to empathize and connect with people in a meaningful way. My experience with problem solving countless matters in the backcountry, with kids of all ages, has cultivated my perspective on solution-based thinking. My past experience has made me the designer I am today, as I naturally take initiative to identify any potential issues, and to address them.
            Educators are resilient, passionate, inventive professionals who always put the needs of their students before their own. With this adopted attitude, I am able to creatively produce quality designs with immaculate precision, while always considering the user first. As an (Outdoor) Educator, one must be flexible and embracing of change at any time. Owning this skill has cultivated my ability to remain adaptable through transitions and has demonstrated its value in my career with Design, as I am able to embrace change very comfortably.
            When I am not designing, I can be found enjoying the great outdoors with my husband and dog, reading a good book, or enjoying moments with my friends or family.
